# Contributing to Bungalow64 nopCommerce plugins

Bungalow64 plugins will be more successful when we're all involved in making it better.  That's why all source code is here on GitHub, so you can see what's going on, and give everyone an opportunity to make the changes that they want to see.

There's just a few things we need to ask if you're wanting to contribute:

- Please make pull requests against the relevant version branch - we will merge it into master when it's going to be released
- Please make sure the [C# Coding Guidelines](https://csharpcodingguidelines.com/) are followed (the only difference being is if you use British English, we won't be too upset!)
- Please try and add as many useful unit tests as possible
- If you're unsure whether it's worth adding a new feature, raise it in [Issues](https://github.com/Bungalow64/NOP-Plugin-ScheduleTaskLog/issues), and we'll have a chat about it

We can't guarantee that every change proposed will make it in - we need to consider the overall direction of the plugin, the on-going maintenance costs, and backwards compatibility.  If we can see the benefit of something though, we'll do our best to get it in.
